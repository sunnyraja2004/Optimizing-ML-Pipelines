# Optimizing-ML-Pipelines
PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project focuses on solving a binary classification problem using diverse datasets, each presenting unique challenges in feature representation and model selection. By leveraging both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning models, the team achieved high classification accuracy across datasets, demonstrating the importance of tailored feature engineering and model optimization.

KEY FEATURES

Dataset 1 (Emoticon Sequences): Achieved 93.25% accuracy using Logistic Regression with one-hot encoded features.

Dataset 2 (High-Dimensional Matrices): Implemented dimensionality reduction via PCA and applied Support Vector Machines (SVM), resulting in 99.12% accuracy.

Dataset 3 (Sequential Digits): Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture spatial and sequential patterns, achieving 87.14% accuracy within parameter constraints.

Combined Dataset Approach: Integrated multiple datasets using feature transformations and trained Logistic Regression and SVM models, reaching a maximum accuracy of 98.51%.
